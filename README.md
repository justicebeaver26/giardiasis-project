# Giardiasis Case Prediction and Analysis  

## 1. Purpose  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the distribution of **giardiasis cases** across different US states, age groups, and sexes.  
The primary aim is to understand how demographic factors influence infection patterns and to generate insights that can guide **public health interventions**.  

## 2. Data Collection   
- Data was sourced from reported giardiasis cases from CDC.  
- Variables used:  
  - **Age groups** (e.g., children, adults, elderly).  
  - **Sex** (male/female).  
  - **States** (geographic regions where cases were recorded).  
- The dataset was processed through Python for exploratory analysis.  

## 3. Data Cleaning  
- Standardized categorical variables (age group labels, state codes, sex).  
- Handled missing or inconsistent entries.  
- Ensured numerical integrity for case counts.  
- Aggregated data for analysis by **state, sex, and age group**.  

## 4. Modelling  
- Used Python to compute and visualize:  
  - Number of cases and incidence rates in each state, broken down by **sex**.  
  - Number of cases and incidence rates in each state, broken down by **age groups and sex**.  
- Analytical methods included grouping, aggregation, and comparison across categories.  
- Visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps) were created to highlight patterns.  

## 5. Dashboards Showing Key Metrics  
- **State-wise distribution of cases by sex.**  
- **Age group × Sex × State comparisons.**  
- Interactive plots (if run in Jupyter) for filtering by demographic categories.  

## 6. Conclusion  
- Clear demographic differences in giardiasis cases were observed.  
- **Sex-based patterns** showed notable variation across states.  
- **Age and sex together** provided deeper insights into vulnerable groups.  
- These results emphasize the importance of **targeted public health strategies** based on both demographic and geographic factors.
